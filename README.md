# About our Topic: Text Classification

# Problem
Text classification is a machine-learning technique that is fundamental to natural language processing
(NLP), a field of artificial intelligence, linguistics, and computer science. NLP is the idea that a machine can
break down text to understand how humans communicate and convey information. With the rise of social media,
text classification is becoming more and more important since the amount of information increases exponentially
every second. With such insurmountable amounts of this data and the many ways it can be interpreted, it'd take too long for an
individual or even a group of people to analyze and understand this data. As a result, having machines analyze
and understand this data is much more ideal as they are fast, efficient, and don’t tire, saving a lot of time and
personnel. We will  be discussing how text classification works and showcase its applications with
two supervised learning models and one unsupervised learning model.

# Solution
most shared data is completely unstructured and left for interpretation.
Recent studies show that around 80% of all data being shared in text form is unstructured. We can
use machine learning to categorize this data efficiently by training it to relate patterns and classify
text with a target value. More specifically, this “training” is the process of breaking down text and
assigning a category or a tag to each individual piece. These assigned tags provide some insight on
the overall meaning of the analyzed text. Machines, however, don’t understand the nuances of human
communication, and so we must teach them to understand language structure and phrase structure. 
For a machine learning model to even do this, it is given various tools and methods that separate text and extract features from it.
One of these methods involves vectorization techniques. These vectorization techniques break down text into
smaller individual components known as vectors to make data more digestible for a machine to
analyze. Additionally, there are other methods for feature extraction such as Stemming and
Lemmatization, which involves simplifying a word and its many different forms of usage to its simple
root or base word respectively.

In the realm of data analysis, where approximately 80% of shared information exists in unstructured text form, machine learning becomes a pivotal tool for efficient categorization. 
This involves training models like Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to discern patterns and assign relevant tags to pieces of text. 
These models, however, necessitate the comprehension of language nuances and structure, prompting the use of techniques like vectorization, stemming, and lemmatization.
Vectorization involves breaking down text into digestible vectors, while stemming and lemmatization simplify words to their root forms. 
In parallel, deep learning, facilitated by frameworks like TensorFlow, introduces neural networks, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to comprehend the sequential nature of language, capturing intricate patterns. Collectively, these approaches empower machines to process and analyze unstructured text efficiently, enhancing their understanding of the inherent structure and meaning within the data.
